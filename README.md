Hi... I'm a rookie, I like learning design because it's fun and colorful 😊 Creating a program also makes me curious 🧐 I started learning Python but ended up getting stuck 🥴 and now I'm starting to like it, yay...!!! 😆 (that's because I'm starting to understand it little by little 🥲)

Oh, and I also love watching anime and Korean dramas 🍿  
My favorite anime are Attack on Titan, One Piece, Demon Slayer, and Ghibli  
My favorite dramas are Nine Puzzles, The Glory, Someone, and D.P  
My favorite movies... (I can't possibly list them all, can I? 🤔)
